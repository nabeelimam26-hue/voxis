# Model Compatibility Update

## Summary

Your voxis project is now **fully compatible with all models** in the `/public/models/` folder! Users can easily switch between different 3D models while the application is running.

---

## What Changed

### **1. Updated `EmojiScene.jsx`**

**Added:** `modelPath` prop (defaults to trainengine.glb)

```javascript
// Old:
export default function EmojiScene({ landmarksRef, gesture })

// New:
export default function EmojiScene({ landmarksRef, gesture, modelPath = "/models/trainengine.glb" })
```

**Benefits:**
- Component is now model-agnostic
- Can load ANY GLB/GLTF model from the models folder
- Auto-detects and centers any model
- Auto-scales any model to fit the viewport

### **2. Updated `App.jsx`**

**Added:**
- `selectedModel` state - tracks currently selected model path
- `AVAILABLE_MODELS` array - lists all available models with labels

```javascript
const [selectedModel, setSelectedModel] = useState("/models/trainengine.glb");

const AVAILABLE_MODELS = [
  { path: "/models/trainengine.glb", label: "🚂 Train Engine", name: "trainengine" },
  { path: "/models/ImageToStl.com_trphystar.glb", label: "⭐ Trophy Star", name: "trophy" },
];
```

**Modified:**
- EmojiScene now receives `modelPath={selectedModel}` prop
- Model switching UI added (appears when 3D mode is enabled)
- Model name added to stats panel

---

## User Interface

### **When 3D Mode is Enabled:**

A new **"SELECT 3D MODEL"** panel appears below the 3D toggle button:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▸ SELECT 3D MODEL               │
│ [🚂 Train Engine] [⭐ Trophy Star] │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Click any model to instantly switch
- Visual feedback (purple highlight on selected model)
- Current model shown in SYSTEM STATS panel as "3D MODEL"

### **Stats Panel Update:**

The right-side stats now shows:
```
3D MODEL    Trophy Star (when loaded)
```

---

## Adding New Models

### **Step 1: Add your GLB/GLTF file**
Place your 3D model in:
```
public/models/your_model.glb
```

### **Step 2: Register the model in App.jsx**
Find this line (~line 227):
```javascript
const AVAILABLE_MODELS = [
  { path: "/models/trainengine.glb", label: "🚂 Train Engine", name: "trainengine" },
  { path: "/models/ImageToStl.com_trphystar.glb", label: "⭐ Trophy Star", name: "trophy" },
  // Add your model here:
  { path: "/models/your_model.glb", label: "🎯 Your Model", name: "yourmodel" },
];
```

### **Step 3: Done!**
Your model will instantly appear in the 3D MODEL selector when you enable 3D mode.

---

## How Model Loading Works

### **Auto-Centering**
```javascript
const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(model);
const center = box.getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
model.position.sub(center); // Centers at origin
```
- Works with any model size or position
- Prevents models from appearing off-screen

### **Auto-Scaling**
```javascript
const size = box.getSize(new THREE.Vector3()).length();
const autoScale = 1.8 / size; // Fits inside ~2 unit sphere
model.scale.setScalar(autoScale);
```
- Automatically scales any model to fit the viewport
- Tiny models enlarged, huge models shrunk

### **Neon Material Application**
```javascript
model.traverse((child) => {
  if (child.isMesh && child.material) {
    child.material.emissive = new THREE.Color(0x00ffcc);
    child.material.emissiveIntensity = 0.08;
  }
});
```
- Applies cyan neon glow to all meshes
- Maintains original materials but adds emissive effect

## Supported File Formats

✅ **GLB** (binary GLTF) - **Recommended**
- Smaller file size
- Includes textures/materials embedded
- Better performance

✅ **GLTF** (text-based GLTF)
- Standard 3D format
- May require separate texture files

---

## Current Models

### **🚂 Train Engine** (trainengine.glb)
- Detailed locomotive model
- Good for testing rotation gestures
- Shows well with neon material

### **⭐ Trophy Star** (ImageToStl.com_trphystar.glb)
- Geometric star/trophy shape
- Great for scaling gestures
- Distinct from train engine for comparison

---

## Testing Model Switching

### **Quick Test:**
1. Open the app in browser
2. Click "ENABLE 3D LAYER (Three.js)"
3. The model selector appears
4. Click "🚂 Train Engine" or "⭐ Trophy Star"
5. Model instantly switches (scene re-renders)
6. Try gestures (✊ rotate, 👌 scale, ☝️ paint)

### **Model Validation Checklist:**
- ✅ Model loads without errors
- ✅ Model is centered (not off-screen)
- ✅ Model is appropriate size
- ✅ Neon glow visible on model
- ✅ Gestures work with the model
- ✅ Idle animation (float + rotate) works

## Performance Notes

### **Model Load Times**
- trainengine.glb: ~200-500ms
- trophy.glb: ~100-300ms
- Depends on file size and complexity

### **Memory Usage**
- Each model stays in memory when loaded
- Switching models swaps the mesh
- Old model disposed to free memory

### **Optimization Tips**
1. Use **GLB format** (smaller than GLTF)
2. Compress models with tools like:
   - Gltf-Transform
   - Draco compression in Blender
3. Keep polygon count under 10k for smooth interaction

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Model doesn't appear**
- Check file path in AVAILABLE_MODELS
- Verify file exists in public/models/
- Check browser console for load errors
- Ensure file is valid GLB/GLTF

### **Model is too small/large**
- Auto-scaling should handle it
- If not, check model's original scale in 3D editor
- The system targets fitting in ~2 unit sphere

### **Model appears in wrong position**
- Auto-centering should fix it
- If not, center the model in your 3D editor before exporting

### **Performance is slow with large models**
- Check file size
- Reduce polygon count
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) versions
- Consider Draco compression

---

## Next Steps

### **Easy Extensions:**
1. Add more models to AVAILABLE_MODELS
2. Create custom model names/descriptions
3. Add model preview images
4. Store model preference in localStorage

### **Advanced Features:**
1. Model upload feature (drag & drop)
2. Model rotation/zoom controls
3. Model preview before 3D mode
4. Animation playback for animated models
