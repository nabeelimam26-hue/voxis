# voxis Refactoring - Complete Guide

## What Was Done

Your project has been successfully refactored into a **clean, modular structure** with these 3 new files:

###  **1. `/src/utils/useFaceTracker.js`** - AI/Hand Tracking Logic
This custom React hook encapsulates all MediaPipe HandLandmarker functionality:

```javascript
const { 
  handLandmarkerRef, 
  loadModel,                    // Load MediaPipe model
  detectFromImage,              // Detect from static image
  startDetectionLoop,           // Start continuous detection
  stopDetectionLoop,            // Stop detection
  cleanup                       // Cleanup resources
} = useFaceTracker();
```

**Key benefit:** All MediaPipe imports and initialization are hidden here. App.jsx is much cleaner.

---

### **2. `/src/components/EmojiScene.jsx`** - 3D Scene Component  
All Three.js logic is now isolated in this single component:

**Features:**
- Complete 3D scene setup (lights, camera, renderer, grid, stars)
- **⭐ Smooth Lerp-Based Movement (LERP_ALPHA = 0.1)**
  - This is the key to smooth performance on Samsung Galaxy F12
  - Lower lerp factor = smoother interpolation
  - Prevents jittery hand tracking
  
- **Gesture Interactions in 3D:**
  - `✊ Fist` → Rotate model by hand delta
  - `👌 OK gesture` → Scale model (pinch gesture)
  - `☝️ Point` → Paint 3D spheres in space
  - `🖐️ Open Palm` → Explode paint trail outward
  - `👎 Thumbs Down` → Clear paint trail

- **Idle Animation:** Model floats and rotates when no hand detected
- **Paint Trail System:** Colored spheres fade over time

**Props:**
```javascript
<EmojiScene 
  landmarksRef={landmarksRef}    // Live hand landmarks
  gesture={currentGesture}       // Current gesture from App
/>
```

---

### **3. Updated `/src/App.jsx`** - Main Orchestrator
Now much cleaner and focused on:
- UI management
- Gesture recognition logic  
- Action handling (sounds, particles, etc.)
- State management

**What Changed:**
- ✅ Replaced `import ThreeCanvas` with `import EmojiScene`
- ✅ Added `import { useFaceTracker }`
- ✅ Initialize hook: `const { ... } = useFaceTracker()`
- ✅ Updated `detectFromImage()` to use hook
- ✅ Updated `startDetectionLoop()` to use hook with callbacks
- ✅ All UI and gesture logic remains intact

## Architecture Diagram

```
App.jsx (Orchestrator)
  ├── useF aceTracker() hook
  │   └── MediaPipe HandLandmarker
  │       └── Hand detection & tracking
  │
  ├── <canvas> (2D canvas)
  │   └── drawHand() - renders MediaPipe landmarks
  │
  └── <EmojiScene> (3D layer)
      ├── Three.js Scene
      ├── Live landmarks from App →  lerpVec3() smooth movement
      └── Gesture-based 3D interactions
```

---

## Performance Optimization: Smooth Lerp Movement

**In `EmojiScene.jsx` (line 14):**
```javascript
const LERP_ALPHA = 0.1; // ← This is your magic number!
```

**How it works:**
- Each frame, the 3D model position interpolates 10% of the way toward the target
- Formula: `new_pos = old_pos + (target_pos - old_pos) * 0.1`
- Result: Extremely smooth, jitter-free tracking
- Perfect for mobile devices like Samsung Galaxy F12

**To adjust smoothness:**
- `0.05` = Even smoother (more lag, less responsive)
- `0.1` = Balanced (DEFAULT - recommended)
- `0.2` = More responsive (less smooth, more jittery)

## Testing the Refactored Code

### **Step 1: Start Dev Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Test Each Mode**

1. **Static Image Mode**
   - Click "STATIC IMAGE" tab
   - Click "RUN DETECTION ON hand.jpg"
   - Verify hand landmarks appear and gesture is recognized

2. **Video File Mode**
   - Click "VIDEO FILE" tab
   - Click "PLAY hand.mp4"
   - Verify gesture detection works smoothly

3. **Webcam Mode**
   - Click "LIVE WEBCAM" tab
   - Click "START WEBCAM"
   - Show different hand gestures
   - Verify real-time tracking works

### **Step 3: Enable 3D Layer**
- Click "ENABLE 3D LAYER" button
- Verify:
  - ✊ Fist gesture → Model rotates
  - 👌 OK gesture → Model scales
  - ☝️ Point gesture → Paint spheres appear
  - Hand movement is **SMOOTH** and responsive

### **Step 4: Mobile Testing**
- Open on Samsung Galaxy F12
- Test webcam mode with gestures
- Verify smooth tracking with LERP_ALPHA = 0.1

## Smooth Movement Explained

### **Before (Without Lerp):**
```
Hand Position: X=100 → Model jumps instantly to X=100
Result: Jittery, jarring movement ❌
```

### **After (With Lerp Alpha 0.1):**
```
Frame 1: Model at X=0, target X=100 → moves to X=10
Frame 2: Model at X=10, target X=100 → moves to X=19
Frame 3: Model at X=19, target X=100 → moves to X=28
...gradually animates smoothly to X=100 ✅
```

This is especially important on mobile devices where frame rate might fluctuate.

---

## Code Quality

✅ **Modular:** Each component has a single responsibility  
✅ **Reusable:** Custom hook can be used in other projects  
✅ **Maintainable:** Changes to 3D logic don't affect gesture logic  
✅ **Performance:** Optimized with LERP for mobile  
✅ **Clean:** App.jsx is much easier to read  

---

## What Stayed The Same

- All gesture recognition logic (`classifyGesture`, `getFingerStates`)
- All action handlers (sounds, particles, notes, screenshots, etc.)
- UI layout and styling
- Theme system
- Note/screenshot management
- Combo system
- All existing features

---

## Summary

Your refactored **voxis** project now has:

1. ✅ **Modular 3D Logic** - Separated into `EmojiScene.jsx`
2. ✅ **Custom AI Hook** - All hand tracking in `useFaceTracker.js`
3. ✅ **Optimized Movement** - Smooth LERP-based lerp factor 0.1 for mobile
4. ✅ **Clean Architecture** - App.jsx is the orchestrator
5. ✅ **Same Features** - All functionality preserved

**Ready to deploy!** 🚀
